        <Focus:content>But that was also part of the difficulty because you realise after two years for instance that in social sciences for instance we do have a much longer or much smooth rhythm of doing research.nSP1	Okay.nSP2	First of all because we also need to go inside of city to collect... To have data but also social sciences take more time to implement, to research, to... Because we need to check a lot of different factors which is the same also in engineering for sure.  But my experience or our experience on doing research in a multidisciplinary is that sometimes, not always in that was everyone of course.  But every topic or discipline but sometimes in engineer it�s much more... The speed is much more higher.nSP1	Yes, yes.nSP2	And here you do have some times of discrepancy between the rhythm, much more long, much more... I will not say deep because it�s not a question of deepness but it just... It�s another way of doing research.nSP1	Yes.nSP2	And that is something that we experience a couple of time when we did some research for instance with engineer.nSP3	Yes.nSP2	For instance in social science you cannot have result after one month.nSP1	Yes, sure.nSP2	You need to do field work, you need to reflect on text, you need to organise a problematic, you need to understand so many vary other factors.nSP1	Yes.nSP2	But then again you need also to have another framework, a more general universal framework to see what are the differences and that takes times.nSP1	Yes, sure.nSP2	It�s not... And sometimes my... Our feeling was that was engineer as it is more sometimes based on modelling, on other types of experience you got result more quicker.  nSP1	Yes, okay.nSP2	And that can be sometimes more..</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>So this last year�s week I think was... The lessons that we learn every year is that it works actually, so the students are typically engaged, highly motivated and they produce some remarkable results there in this short amount of time.  It�s also true that the amount of creativity or good ideas is limited, so we see that similar ideas pop up every year, which is also natural, that�s not a problem, so that�s another lesson.  </Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>I think it�s an important part of the Bachelor curriculum, so it�s important for the students, but it�s also important for us because it is the first contact with the students and a quite close contact, so they get to see us in an environment that is much more relaxed and if they have to deal with my radiation transfer modelling in the atmosphere which makes them a little bit tight sometimes, and so I think it�s good, it�s good for both sides, yes I�m a real supporter of that idea</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>Yes I think, as I said, you know, it�s the first early contact with the students in a fairly relaxed environment.  I think it is very useful, so I perceive our role as professors as really also to teach to students something that they can use, and I think in that respect I feel that this format is quite effective in actually doing this.

Maybe, like we had before the week of the one session of teaching before, but the idea� I would like to be able to do that in my classes, have classes like that in my university.  I would really like to have that kind of teaching.  Like, I mean, in some business schools it�s the usual kind of teaching, like you have� Well, it�s not� It�s more formal but it�s, you have a case study and you have to solve the case and then you present your solution and the professor helps you to, like, figure out what you need to do to improve your solution.  </Focus:content>

So they have learned something also, so it�s really� I mean, the fact that we are able to get all this thing that are not as easily put together, together is really the chemistry of the thing.

        <Focus:content>No.nSP2	But I think overall there is definitely a positive feedback, you know the projects of the students, what they have done.  You know also where difficulties were encountered in terms of feasibility of projects, I think you also get a good sense of judging what kind of project is possible in a given timeframe.  That is I think that can be translated to same as the projects or master projects that you can define a project for a student that is challenging but still feasible.  And not after three months you realise oh, this was only the introduction and there is no time to do the core of the work.nSP1	Okay.nSP2	So I think that is nice and then it also opens a bit perspectives for your own research that you know also other colleagues, you know their work and I think if need be you could integrate elements from this experience.  And use the network of the Semaine ENAC to incorporate or to link your work or elements of their work with what you are doing.nSP1	So for your own interdisciplinary work if you like.nSP2	And finally it also helps for teaching other classes I think you can always make reference to a... To these things or bringing examples from Semaine ENAC.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>One of the things is that they should practice what they usually apply only in theoretical courses, just as one main issue is really to handle tools and to like make a project but not only, to also calculate it, but also to build it at the end, which is where, for me just, from my experience it was really not so easy for them.  Because they did not even know the names of basic tools, so I think from this point they learnt a lot.  n	And then the second thing was to have to work together, and they learnt how the architects worked, how civil engineering are thinking and working and some of the other side they had to help them, because architects they can, they do drawings so they draw for civil engineers, and civil engineers help architects to design structures.

        <Focus:content> And what do you think about the competences in this and ENAC, which are the key competences, your top?nSP2	So think we have this true interdisciplinary ream where we have, first of all, you know, we are from the environmental sciences service, strong background in energy and mass transport questions, energy balance, everything that has to do with the physics of the earth surface.  That�s the key competence on the environmental sciences question, so we can measure heat fluxes with them, we can measure radiation transfer and explain them how diffuse or and direct radiation works and how that is reflected by the snow surface.  n	Things like that are key competences and then we combine that with the competence on how to actually construct and design buildings, also from an energy point of view.  And that is more the architectural side of competence that we bring in there.  Where we have a focus however again on the energy physics so we�re doing a lot of... The students choose to do something with renewable energy, say solar or wind in the mountain environment, a little bit of hydro power.

        <Focus:content>So I think there are these four main competencies. So environmental aspects and architectural, energy, and then financial.

So probably the main competence that is taught is really try to learn how to work in an interdisciplinary environment, and being able to find the right compromise with the rest of the group to optimise the entire project. And being able to concentrate the energy and join forces to achieve a good quality project. And again I think, think out of the box. And learning to work in a broad perspective of sustainability, and getting familiar with new themes like energy; energy deficiency or economic feasibility.nSP1	Yes, so yes. On more concerning the social aspects, what do you think about the social competencies?nSP2	I think this is a bit lacking. I think it�s probably still a bit lacking in academia when talking about environmental design, unfortunately. Although we� There is potential inside [inaudible], I think, to get more collaboration with people who work in this direction, and I would be very interested in working, for example, on some interdisciplinary projects who also take into account social aspects.

If they want to measure something then we have to show them how to set up the instruments, how to read out the data on the logger, how to... n	We give them also preconfigured Excel sheets because otherwise in a week it will be difficult for them to programme enough to get stuff out.  So they get first solid hands-on experience by supervised work that they do themselves, I mean we really focus on that they should do the work themselves.  And also do some background search on the internet, see what data they find and if we have the impression that they didn�t find the right data then we point them to the right sources or even give them the data like on energy production and things.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>So here we have basically once they define their projects we help them of course with defining their project, I should also mention that we do an excursion.nSP1	Right.nSP2	So that is the students get familiar with the environment where they are and that they really see in which context they are working, I think that�s also important, that�s a half day excursion but it gives them a good impression.  And then in terms of teaching we are a big team I think, like this year we were six, seven for 25 students that�s quite an impressive ratio.  And we accompany them in their process of doing a project and we interact a lot with them in group discussions like all the experts from the teaching side talking to the individual groups.  We have usually groups of five students and so after the lectures it becomes really, really interactive and another I think interesting tool that we are using is what we call the desk critique.  That all teachers come typically twice during the week and visit the small groups and we discuss with them their project, this is like a collective, interactive discussion.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>the week was structured in terms of these testing sessions.  And you know, as you know it�s very few days.  And I think it�s also structured on the material limitations that they have to work with, in the sense that they first day they�re, you know, working with wood that they find in the forest.  nYou know, the second one they�re working with wood members that they�re just being introduced to, so something which is a totally new material.  And the third time they do the project, they�re working with material that�s a little bit more familiar to them, in that they�ve already done it once.  So you know, in that sense, these three sessions structure the hands on element.  nAnd I would say that the lectures, the two lectures that we did are, you know, come at the early part of the week to maybe put them in a mind-set that makes them a little critical of reflective of how they�re working.  So that they can not only do things and work together, but also maybe be in mind-set to kind of think about how they�re doing things, and think about how they�re working together.</Focus:content>

They have model, they have mathematics models, they need to make the calculation.nSP1	Sure.nSP2	And it�s... Of course it takes time but at least they do have [foreign language]...nSP3	A result or something they can show.nSP2	Yes, but how, I�m just looking... Yes, when you do a calculation... You do have... What is the name?nSP3	An equation.nSP2	An equation for instance.nSP1	Okay.nSP2	And it�s based on an equation they can... Okay they have some factors maybe.nSP1	Hard facts.nSP2	Yes, exactly and they kind of say okay, that is how we can calculate the... I don�t know the way we can put on the container or not...nSP1	Yes, sure.nSP2	And it�s much more quicker which is not the case for us for instance.nSP1	Yes, it�s much more concrete.nSP2	But that�s also what makes the ENAC week interesting.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>So the very first start was a project, we launch with Alan Izbaumer [?] who�s related to a seed money from ENAC faculty.  It was a seed money on urban incentive and the idea was to work on a project that Alan had once developed with a colleague of him and his own bag about the use of containers.  And how does that context and they apply for F&amp;S grant, they didn�t have it.  It was a [inaudible] research and one of the main critic had in the expertise was the luck of social dimension, a cultural dimension of the project.nSP1	Okay.nSP2	So that was the very base of the project where Alan proposed to Eva [inaudible] as a people representing a different lab or institute to try to collaborate together and to launch a new project.  Which includes really our EIJS our competencies about cultural and social dimension.  And so we launch this project we won one of the seed money amongst others and on the same line Alan decided to launch also the ENAC week with a high potential because it includes multidisciplinary project. nSP1	Yes.nSP2	And so this... All this project plus since 2014 we had some semester project also based globally on the use of containers in different situation and all these different activities actually form actually the core... Basic core of this ENAC.  So all these different project with the help of different teach with also the help of student that did some research, some project help us to organise this project.</Focus:content>

So I think they really wanted to have the integration of different expertise, and not only related to that centre that�s based there in Davos.n	And so, yes, I tried to work on the development of best practice to be applied in the built environment, in that type of environment.

The first year, we had the idea of� There is a snow-oriented idea at the very beginning.  It�s the approach that I�  And, in fact, it was not me in my lab that has been approached, it was another, a colleague who did the thing about climate change, snow coverage and economic impact.  Some economies that do general equilibrium models, and they found out that, well, climate change and low Earth, no coverage is good for Switzerland, in a general equilibrium model.  Because other countries will be more impacted than Switzerland, so the demand will go to Switzerland and the price will increase and the value added will increase.

        <Focus:content>what was your personal, your own main motivation to engage in this ENAC week?nSP2	I would say in our case it was slightly... Well all cases are particular I assume.  I got involved when shortly after Mihi [?] arrived here as a prof and he was kind of building up his teaching activities.  And I think it was also a part of his agreement that he would take over one of these Semaine ENAC.  And for me he wanted to involve me immediately, for me it was the time where I started to build up my personal teaching portfolio.  So there was like a double interest, one from my personal side to get involved, engaged in teaching and another one slightly more tucked down from... More the lead on Mihi to get involved in something.  And this seemed to be to me a good opportunity as an interdisciplinary course to learn something about the faculty and something beyond my own field. </Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>So we set up a concept for a version one I should say that first Semaine ENAC was in 2012 for us so we... This year we had addition number five.  So we can also, we have a little tradition already so that we can definitely talk about an evolution.  The evolution was linked a little bit to the teaching staff where we had over the years a bit of fluctuation.  Some people joining, some people leaving and of course this always brings a little bit different... New elements in a way but we did not change the overall topic that remained.  But I think from year to year we got a bit more professional and more experience.  The topics remained, we also saw after the first one or two editions what was feasible, what we can ask for, what they can do in a week.  And I think at the end as I said we... The topic did not change so much, that means we did in my opinion a pretty good choice at the beginning.  Which was fairly well thought because the very first year we really spent a lot of times, we had long documents and we were circulating these documents between teaching staff part of... Or teachers of this particular Semaine ENAC.  And tailored it such that we really integrated elements from all three sections.  So in this sense I think there was not a major turn but every year we optimised a bit. </Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>So I saw that call, and thought it would be a good idea.  And then, you know, it was just I think brainstorming about how that could be put into place.  nAnd I think the idea of kind of making seemed a natural way to work.  And then, you know, the question of kind of what they make, what they could build became an important one, or an interesting one.  And I had seen that there was a competition that I think ENAC sponsored to build a bridge out of toothpicks.  nOr something like this that they do every year, where architects and sometimes engineers end up doing some proposed, you know, a model that they then have to use to carry a certain weight.  So that made me think something in that context.  nBut I wanted it to be at a larger scale.  And I wanted it to be at the scale of an actual object that would have an actual function, also.  And then, the idea of the cantilever was just something that I had been thinking about.  Obviously, just as an interesting kind of structural idea, which has also certain kinds of implications, in terms of kind of its representational or representative qualities.  nSo it brought together kind of structural ideas with architectural ideas with also, in terms of building that out of wood.  I think, you know, this idea of kind of resources or materials, and what that would mean to work with that.</Focus:content>

And that�s also what we realised, so when we had, as I said, this Wim van der Hoede [?] who was quite essential in the initial setup of the project, he brought in more architectural aspects for very small models, so it was important for him to look at the structural properties of these models.  n	And so you have to, I think the recipe for success is get a good, it�s like always, get a good team and then, you know, and then see where is the compromise between the team and the original idea.

        <Focus:content>Okay and so coming back to the inter-disciplinary thing, what do you think is the key inter-disciplinary aspect of your week, generally speaking?nSP2	The key aspect is that they have to develop one project, so say a house for example or a cable car installation or something, but it�s one project where we cover all the inter-disciplinary aspects that are related to that project.  So they have to do the economic assessment, if it makes economic sense, they have to make the design, the architectural or design aspect of it and they have to, it has to be renewable so they have to look at it from an environmental side and an energy side, so they have to do calculations, is the energy input sufficient for what they want to achieve, is the house self-sufficient with respect to energy or not, is the cable car running on solar only, is that possible, how much storage do you need.  </Focus:content>

So there is this inter-competency, this interdisciplinary, like, sharing.  They have to get into a common ground, and it�s never hard, at least for the part of engineers versus architects.  Sometimes for the economics there is some resistance, the students, they don�t like the capitalist guy.  But that�s also very valuable to bring back the architect on the side of the realistic thing, and bringing the civil engineer on the side of, well, we still need to produce something that will be part of the landscape</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>And well so last question for this part which are the key or is the key interdisciplinary aspect of your week?  How would you describe it?nSP2	We tried to put as much of these aspects in the title of the Semaine ENAC, the title was a little longer, I think a few years ago and then the academic service said you have 140 characters or whatever and we had to reduce.  So I think our original idea was to group the interdisciplinary aspect around two key words.  One is renewable energy and this is really applied to different scales, like from the smallest scale of having a small standalone unit to large scale energy production.  Or energy storage in the landscape.  And the second element is I would say sustainability, again, in a very large sense sustainability with respect to or applied to landscape and a natural environment and to build infrastructure.  And bringing all these together I think we have two elements that give a wealth of questions, interesting and relevant to the students of the three sections.  Because all of them are concerned with energy question, the architects when designing buildings, the civil engineers anyway for maybe power production.  The environmental engineering... Engineers as well for also handling energy, transmission.  nBut then also citing of infrastructures work and they put these things where we have natural risks and hazards, how does it integrate in the landscape, how does it integrate with valid regulations and law and so on?  And in this context I should also mention that... And that�s maybe a bit particular of our Semaine ENAC that we are also covering economic aspects which I think is nice and it�s probably for most of them a new element.  They don�t have this in class or anything, we have a dedicated specialist or expert for that and I think it�s a nice component to bring... To develop a project where you also do at least a basic calculation to see that it�s something realistic and maybe viable.</Focus:content>

Because until last year I was in the dean�s office for six years and I followed this process quite a bit.  There was also two years... Was it two years ago?  No, for the last year edition some the budget for you know what they called high potential Semaine ENAC so there was an additional budget to get I don�t know, buy equipment or improve the existing Semaine ENAC or to create new ones.  And so there were a couple of incentives to promote this and now I would say with the succession of Jean d�Anie [?] who did the Jean d�Anie [inaudible], who did the [inaudible] before now with Monique there is a new dynamic.  And I think people start to feel that it is... That the whole concept of Projeter d&apos;Ensemble is supported and carried by ENAC, by direction of ENAC as well.  nAnd what�s still not completely clear is the valorisation and appreciation of those who are really involved and engaged that you know, sometimes it�s... Some colleagues still consider it as not really as hard science and like a... If you want to really be nasty and a waste of time for like a bit of... A week of blah blah and we are really motivated to change this image and I think our Semaine ENAC is fairly substantial.  It�s calculation, it�s design, it�s involvement, I think it is...

        <Focus:content>the first version was already quite successful.  n	And it seemed the key to success there was that we were available during the Week to guide the students in their individual development and steps, so we were sort of very closely following what they were actually doing.

And that, to be honest, I think it didn�t work out that well in 2015, for, I don&apos;t know what reasons.  We didn�t actually have a really serious debriefing to talk about it, which is a bit unfortunate. </Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>What�s your main motivation to engage in this ENAC week?nSP2	So, there are a few reasons why I choose to be involved in this Semaine ENAC. First of all because I was interested in improving my teaching skills so it was for really personal interest. And I was really excited to work in an interdisciplinary environment because throughout my education� So both my master�s degree in architectural engineering which is already kind of hybrid and interdisciplinary by definition, and then a PhD as an engineer, got in the Department of Architecture, carrying out a thesis which focused on environmental design, was already sort of in keeping on working on interdisciplinarity in my studies. nAnd so I became more and more aware of the importance of interdisciplinarity today, which in the field of construction and building environment in general is definitely essential. So both at the research and professional level, and started to be considered also as an essential framework for the teaching practice.nAlso I wanted to give myself this challenge, I found it very interesting, and I also liked a lot the fact of coupling theory and practice, that I thought was very interesting as well. nAnd also having some fun, so having some regenerative time with the students in a different environment and out of the usual and daily routine standards of academic, yes, routine.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>What was your motivation to engage in the ENAC week?nSP2	 So, honestly, I was a master student here in this group, in LIPID, and I was followed by Parag who was involved in the course before me. So he was going to finish and he was saying, I would like you to follow my path so why don�t you start to do that. nBut actually I wasn�t a PhD yet, so I started even before being a PhD, and then when I became a PhD I just continued to do the Semaine ENAC. Even if it�s completely different from what I�m doing, but I� Because I want to be broad in my studies so I feel like it�s a great opportunity for me to exploit the different areas of, yes, building physics still, but different.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>So, again as I told you before, it is something not related to my topic, but to me it�s enriching because every time also working with students, I�m learning stuff. And each project is unique so it helping me also for the future to maybe understand different problems. For me it�s like I was doing all the projects, so it was nice. Of course I was not solving their problems, but at the end I was kind of involved. So to me it was� It�s enriching also for me, of course.nSP1	That�s great.nSP2	Yes, in a really different topic so not related to my PhD but in general I think at the end of my PhD I just don�t want to be an expert in a really tiny part of building physics, so I would like to have a broader knowledge. And it is also always useful to have, I think, so I like to do that also for this reason.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>First of all, the main motivation.  Why did you engage in the ENAC Week?  Did and do, still?nSP2	Did, at the beginning it was because they asked me if I wanted to do some economic stuff about snow and impact of snow.  So at the beginning it was really just for snow.  The approach was about snow and it turned out to be, like, an initiation into economics to finance for engineers.  And it�s very nice that this, the few first years I learned a lot about how did the engineers see the things and stuff, and what I can bring them.  So that�s why I�m still involved, and there are a few research projects that we are still talking about that may come out of the Semaine ENAC. </Focus:content>

But even for the environment it�s important because you have a limited amount of resources and you want to have the biggest impact with that limited resources.

        <Focus:content>what was your personal, your own main motivation to engage in this ENAC week?nSP2	I would say in our case it was slightly... Well all cases are particular I assume.  I got involved when shortly after Mihi [?] arrived here as a prof and he was kind of building up his teaching activities.  And I think it was also a part of his agreement that he would take over one of these Semaine ENAC.  And for me he wanted to involve me immediately, for me it was the time where I started to build up my personal teaching portfolio.  So there was like a double interest, one from my personal side to get involved, engaged in teaching and another one slightly more tucked down from... More the lead on Mihi to get involved in something.  And this seemed to be to me a good opportunity as an interdisciplinary course to learn something about the faculty and something beyond my own field. </Focus:content>

The first day was kind of the special, making specialists or project specialists and the second day was about making the project, being in the classroom, and the third day this was working on the site.

He was also helping a lot with trying to see, you know, that they can actually build their little models and all the idea about wind tunnel testing and so that these were locally developed at SLF.  n	And so it was also an interactive process, we then thought it would be good to involve the local energy company so we, since I already knew the CEO there so I asked him if he would come and give a lecture.

An important aspect is to have also the, I didn�t mention him yet, is the Spanish, Joseppe, architect, who is specialised in renewable and environmentally friendly buildings in an Alpine environment.  So he gives his lecture and shows his projects, Hendrik gives some basics on the physics of energy transfer and radiation.  And then we have architectural inputs and so this all gives them a first start-up which is finished in day one, day two, depending on how much we can do beforehand the changes from UTL a little bit.  n	And then in phase two is basically the students will develop then their own concepts with critique from us teachers, so we try to be very present in this phase to try to give them immediate feedback if they go in the wrong, in a direction which will not work very well for them.  But let them develop their concept with the, with a real task that every discipline is represented in the project, so the project should have an energy related part, a physics related part, an environmental related part, an economic part and an architectural part.  And so that�s a requirement and we also judge the initial ideas that they come up with, with respect, and then try to correct where it�s necessary. n	And then phase two is basically the development of their own concepts and already working out various calculations and trying to put a frame on it, structure their own project.  And then phase three is the main work part where they do either theoretically or work on data or they... In addition every project must have an experimental part, so they need to measure something, put their hands on something, either on a model and measure in a cold lab how the temperature decreases with a certain amount of heating or measure some radiation input as in a snowy environment, in a non-snowy environment, look at the differences and do things like that. </Focus:content>

So giving lectures first and then guiding and supervising the students in the practical application of these concepts there. nSo I actually also contributed, since I got involved the last year, proposing this new themes for this Semaine ENAC, of the design of the micro and temporary architecture. That was quite successful because the students found it very, yes, creative, something that you can once in a while go out of the box and invent something and try to, yes, like sort of exaggerate, but in good terms during this week. So also having some fun.nAnd for the rest the week is organised� Well, so some lectures� So there are four different teachers with four different lectures that teach different topics from environmental to economics and architecture, energy.

And in parallel there is also, I think this is very important, to give, to show case studies. So I think it�s important for the students to have reference of something that has been done in a sense, and that they can draw inspiration from.n	And then there is a first phase that is based on observation and discussion, but I would say limited discussion during the first brainstorming of the students among, in their groups. So I�m for giving some freedom in the students to really come up with their idea without influencing them too much, but still try to guide them and, yes, arise some discussion on their concept definition.n	Then there is a third phase of detailed supervision. So then you really can give some technical suggestions and guidance. n	And then there is also the experimental part, so they try to complement what they�re theoretically developing with some practical application. And as teachers we also try to accept their experiments and to guide them and to suggest some methodologies to optimise them.n	And then the final support in the finalisation of the project. n	So these are, I think, the five points of the teaching structure along the week.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>So I just knew that I had to do projects, that there were a few lectures, and then the project were about doing something together between civil, environmental and architecture. So it was not really a detailed project because it was developed in a week, or [inaudible] even, in three days. It was extreme, I think. But, yes, I didn�t know much actually, I just know that it was about a project and about sustainability and building.nSP1	And did you know how, who was in charge and who has which roles or something like that?nSP2	Yes. In Semaine ENAC, yes, I had, I knew that the Mishy [?] was the head of the Semaine ENAC because he was mainly in Davos, so he knew all the facilities in there, he�s responsible for what the students do also there, if there is something that doesn�t go well, it�s his responsibility.n	And then there is Hendrik [?], who is the core, I don�t know, supervisor of the whole group. And then for external issues are Phillipe [?] for, have been there since the beginning I think.n	And then there are, yes, the PhD students I�d say. So, before there was Parag, who was my supervisor, I mentioned you before. And then me and then Luisa, she started with me, and then this year for the first time, we had Riana [?] from Freiburg.</Focus:content>

        <Focus:content>So normally we have the preparatory classes, they... Typically they are three, three hours and in these three hours we give an introduction like a global introduction of what the Semaine ENAC will be about.  This is after they have selected the Semaine ENAC because there is normally in December all the ENAC weeks are presented to all the students and then they make their choice and they get signed up.  And then they come in our Semaine ENAC and we do a kind of introduction to explain them what we are going to do, what is expected from them also.  And then we typically start to give them a common background that means a couple of lectures, well these are lectures but we try to keep them as interactive as possible.  That they can always ask their questions that it could even turn into a discussion while we still manage to give them all the information they need.  But it�s not a classical ex cathedra [?] to some extent yes because you know they are diverse and so we have to create a common base and then we go from there.  nSo that is the preparation and there is a lot of logistics in our case that has to be communicated.  Like because we are not on campus, like where to go, what to bring and so on.  This is... Should not be underestimated, I am typically taking care of all that, I have to say I�m taking care of a big part in terms of the preparation.  Because simply because Mihi has a lower presence here but so I do the presentation in December, I do usually most of the lectures and if somebody other... Somebody else is lecturing I am present.  I do most of the logistics in terms of reservations, get the tickets and inform them.  Set up the Moodle site which is also another key word.</Focus:content>

So also the Semaine ENAC is getting more and more important. nBefore maybe it was just a try, and then they understood that it was important also for students, also by looking at their feedback, so they are really happy to collaborate for the first time and merge with the others which is something that doesn�t happen in the other universities. So it never happened to me, for example, and I wish I could had a similar experience, actually.

If you have one course [inaudible] from other courses in a teaching unit.n	If you have an afternoon, so they came at one o�clock, they work for you and then at four o�clock, five o�clock they say they�ve got a lot of things to do.
